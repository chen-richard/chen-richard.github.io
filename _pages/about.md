I recently obtained my PhD working with [Michael Cole](https://www.colelab.org/) at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers University.

My thesis work investigated the functional relevance of resting-state brain activity. Specifically, I am interested in how the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of resting state brain activity is functionally significant, and how these resting state processes relates to behavior and task-related activity. To explore this question, I used a combination of machine learning, regression, and statistical analyses on large fMRI datasets.

I am interested in data science, applying my research experience onto real-world datasets.
